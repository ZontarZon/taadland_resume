          Unfortunately, while transporting some essentials through the space
          station, Egbert the space cat accidentally activated the SGP
          (Synthetic Gravity Protocol). Poor Egbert thought it meant SGP (Salmon
          and Gravy Pat√©).

        <p>
          This isn't the first time he mistook a label for something else. Last
          time, he mistook the EAS (Evacuation Alarm System) for the EAS (Eggs,
          Ahi, and Sushi).

          Food is now falling to the ground, and he needs to save as much of it
          as he can! Otherwise, he'll get fired, and he has fifteen mouths to
          feed. Yeah. Egbert needs a good TNR ... and I don't mean TNR (Tuna, Nigiri, Roe).

            Food will periodically fall from the ceiling. As food falls to the
            ground, you'll see its shadow grow larger.
